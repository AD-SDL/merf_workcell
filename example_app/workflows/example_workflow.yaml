  #This is a human legible name for the step
  # - name: Sleep workcell for t seconds
  #This defines which module the action will run on, in this case, a test node that simply sleeps for t seconds
    # module: sleeper
  #This tells the module which action in its library to run, in this case grabbing a wellplate from one of the storage tower
    # action: sleep
  #These arguments specify the parameters for the action above, in this case, which tower the arm will pull a plate from.
    # args:
      # t: "payload.wait_time"
  #This represents checks that will take place before the system runs, in this case, there are none specified
    # checks: null
  #This is a place for additional notes
